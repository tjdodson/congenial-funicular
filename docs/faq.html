        <h2>How can I get accurate pricing for my session?</h2>
        <p class="more">Book a consultation.<span class="expand"> ➕ More…</span></p>
        <p class="less hidden">Because almost all sessions are unique and pricing is based on a case-by-case basis, we cannot give you an accurate estimate unless we've met you for a consultation. Consultations are complimentary and commitment-free.<span class="collapse"> ➖ Less…</span></p>

      <section class="faq" id="q2">
        <h2>What is a "shot list"?</h2>
        <p class="more">A "shot list" is a list of key people, locations, or situations that should be captured.<span class="expand"> ➕ More…</span></p>
        <p class="less hidden">Although our photographers have extensive experience in how to make the bride and groom shine, we understand that there are specific shots you may want us to take. But this is not restricted to weddings! Often, event planners need specific shots to show their sponsors or to advertise for future events. A "shot list" is a list of key people, locations, or situations that the client wishes to be captured. With the "shot list," we can ensure our clients get the shots they want without fear of running out of time or forgetting in the excitement of the day.<span class="collapse"> ➖ Less…</span></p>

      <section class="faq" id="q3">
        <h2>What do you mean by "key guests"?</h2>
        <p class="more">We like to provide our clients the opportunity to identify important guests to ensure their inclusion in the photos.<span class="expand"> ➕ More…</span></p>
        <p class="less hidden">We know it takes more than one person to plan and produce an event. We have found that many of our clients often use our photos on their websites to advertise or show to their clients and sponsors. To ensure that these key people are included and our clients are satisfied, we like to provide our clients the opportunity to identify important guests to ensure their inclusion in the photos.<span class="collapse"> ➖ Less…</span></p>

      <section class="faq" id="q4">
        <h2>How does a consultation work?</h2>
        <p class="more">We will have a consultant call to schedule a 30-minute appointment to help plan your event.<span class="expand"> ➕ More…</span></p>
        <p class="less hidden">We want to meet the needs of our clients without breaking the bank, and the consultation enables us to provide a personalized experience for each photo session where you get what you want at a price you can afford. Once you send a request for a consultation using our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>, we will have a consultant call to schedule a 30-minute appointment to discuss your event. During the consultation, you and the consultant will address your requirements and build a custom package—or choose from our set packages—to get everything you want within your budget. The consultant will then pair you with the photographer best fit for your style and availability.<span class="collapse"> ➖ Less…</span></p>

      <section class="faq" id="q5">
        <h2>What is the benefit of an in-studio versus an on-location family portrait session?</h2>
        <p class="more">There are pros and cons for both. The better fit depends on what you're looking for.<span class="expand"> ➕ More…</span></p>
        <p class='less hidden'>The in-studio session allows for a private session with no distractions. We have all of our professional equipment and you have full access to our backgrounds and props. On location, you have the ability to capture nature and create beautiful settings a studio cannot artificially replicate. The better fit depends on what you prefer.<span class="collapse"> ➖ Less…</span></p>
      </section>
      <section class="faq" id="q6">
        <h2>Do you allow walk-ins?</h2>
        <p class="more">We do not accept walk-ins for sessions.<span class="expand"> ➕ More…</span></p>
        <p class="less hidden">If you are looking for a single portrait photo rather than a full photo session, such as for identification on official documents, we accept walk-ins. To ensure high-quality work, we do not accept walk-ins for sessions, as we require a short consultation to go over theme and cost.<span class="collapse"> ➖ Less…</span></p>
