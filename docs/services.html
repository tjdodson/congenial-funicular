            We've become quite renowned for our event photography, so much so that we needed to develop separate <a href="events.html">event</a> and <a href="weddings.html">wedding</a> packages. Session costs start at $400, depending on the number of shots, overall session duration, and the number of subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our most basic package begins at 50 edited proofs; speak with a consultant to see how much it would cost for your perfect session.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the location is greater than 20 miles' distance from the studio, there is an additional cost for travel.
